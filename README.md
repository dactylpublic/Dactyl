<h1>Dactyl: A 1.12.2 forge Anarchy (hack) utility mod</h1>
very old but somehow is still competent.<br>

intentions of updating/fixing my old horrible code.<br>

This was a project that used to be private that I've decided to make public as I do not care for anarchy anymore.<br>
A lot of the code logic is horrible and can be optimized way better, but the base is so basic that it wouldn't be hard.<br><br>
