# Moonlight/Dactyl
This was a project that used to be private that I've decided to make public as I do not care for anarchy anymore.<br>
A lot of the code logic is horrible and can be optimized way better, but the base is so basic that it wouldn't be hard.<br>

very old but somehow is still competent.<br>
the code is 9+ months old, and i do not have 
intentions of updating/fixing my old horrible code.<br>
