<h1>(ARCHIVED) Dactyl: A 1.12.2 Forge (Hacked Client) Utility Mod</h1>
mainly for anarchy servers, specifically 2b2t.<br>
very old but somehow still competent.<br>
the code is 9+ months old, and i do not have 
intentions of updating/fixing/continuing it.<br>

This was a project that used to be private, but I have decided to make public as I do not care for anarchy anymore.<br>
A lot of the code logic is horrible and can be optimized to be way faster/safer, the base is so simple that it wouldn't be hard.<br>
Despite a lot of the rumors, this utiliy mod was in fact custom base.<br><br>
<h3>This is the original GitHub project so older versions are available through commits and may work better for certain servers.<br>(All Versions are 1.12.2)<br><br></h3>

<p><b>I do not thank anyone else besides those involved in this project and I do not plan to involve myself with anarchy in anyway shape or form in the future.</b></p>
