<h1>Dactyl: A 1.12.2 forge Anarchy (hack) utility mod</h1>

intentions of updating/fixing my old horrible code.<br>

This was a project that used to be private that I've decided to make public as I do not care for anarchy anymore.<br>
A lot of the code logic is horrible and can be optimized to be way faster and safe, the base is so simple that it wouldn't be hard.<br><br>
